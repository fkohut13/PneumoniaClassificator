# Overview
This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning and convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray (thorax), scans, By utilizing advanced image processing techniques and Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to highlight affected areas. A user-friendly React frontend allows for easy x-ray images uploads, while the backend processes the images, This integration provides a seamless and efficient diagnostic tool to aid in early pneumonia detection and localization.

## Project Structure
- [frontend/](frontend/): Contains the React frontend application.
- [backend/](backend/): Contains the Python files application for model preprocessing, model training, x-ray preprocessing and finally the output prediction with Class activation mapping (CAM)


## Model training
Using the Radiological Society of North America(RSNA) Dataset, the model was trained on:
20,672 images without pneumonia (~77%)
6,012 images with pneumonia (~23%)
To address data imbalance and accommodate hardware constraints, images are resized to 244x244 pixels. These images are then normalized and standardized (pixel values scaled to [0,1]). The dataset is divided into 24,000 images for training and 2,684 images for validation.

Images are organized into folders based on their class:

0: Healthy lungs
1: Lungs with pneumonia
> [!TIP]
> Approaches for Handling Imbalanced Data
- Do nothing
- Use a weighted loss function
- Oversample the minority class


Data Storage
The X-ray images are converted to numpy arrays. The mean and standard deviation of pixel values are computed for normalization purposes. The images are stored in respective folders according to their binary labels.

This project leverages PyTorch Lightning for efficient and scalable model training, along with TensorBoard for monitoring and visualizing training progress.

# Goal
ðŸ”¬ My ongoing goal is to develop a user-friendly interface for my pneumonia classifier using React, ensuring it is accessible to everyone. This project aims to address real-world healthcare challenges by providing an intuitive tool for detecting pneumonia from X-ray images.
